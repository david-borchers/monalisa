  abstract = {Reliable estimates of animal density are fundamental to understanding ecological processes and population dynamics. Furthermore, their accuracy is vital to conservation because wildlife authorities rely on estimates to make decisions. However, it is notoriously difficult to accurately estimate density for wide-ranging carnivores that occur at low densities. In recent years, significant progress has been made in density estimation of Asian carnivores, but the methods have not been widely adapted to African carnivores, such as lions (Panthera leo). Although abundance indices for lions may produce poor inferences, they continue to be used to estimate density and inform management and policy. We used sighting data from a 3-month survey and adapted a Bayesian spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) model to estimate spatial lion density in the Maasai Mara National Reserve and surrounding conservancies in Kenya. Our unstructured spatial capture-recapture sampling design incorporated search effort to explicitly estimate detection probability and density on a fine spatial scale, making our approach robust in the context of varying detection probabilities. Overall posterior mean lion density was estimated to be 17.08 (posterior SD 1.310) lions >1 year old/100 km 2, and the sex ratio was estimated at 2.2 females to 1 male. Our modeling framework and narrow posterior SD demonstrate that SECR methods can produce statistically rigorous and precise estimates of population parameters, and we argue that they should be favored over less reliable abundance indices. Furthermore, our approach is flexible enough to incorporate different data types, which enables robust population estimates over relatively short survey periods in a variety of systems. Trend analyses are essential to guide conservationdecisions but are frequently based on surveys of differing reliability. We therefore call for a unified framework to assess lion numbers in key populations to improve management and policy decisions.},

  volume   = {55},
  pages    = {1406-1417},
  abstract = {1. Human activities have dramatic effects on the distribution and abundance of wildlife.Increased road densities and human presence in wilderness areas have elevatedhuman-caused mortality of grizzly bears and reduced bears’ use. Managementagencies frequently attempt to reduce human-caused mortality by managing roaddensity and thus human access, but the effectiveness of these actions is rarelyassessed.

2. We combined systematic, DNA-based mark–recapture techniques with spatiallyexplicit capture–recapture models to estimate population size of a threatened grizzlybear population (Kettle–Granby), following management actions to recover thispopulation. We tested the effects of habitat and road density on grizzly bear populationdensity. We tested both a linear and threshold-based road density metric andinvestigated the effect of current access management (closing roads to the public).

3. We documented an c. 50% increase in bear density since 1997 suggesting increasedlandscape and species conservation from management agencies played asignificant role in that increase. However, bear density was lower where road densitiesexceeded 0.6 km/km2 and higher where motorised vehicle access had beenrestricted. The highest bear densities were in areas with large tracts of few or noroads and high habitat quality. Access management bolstered bear density in smallareas by 27%.

4. Synthesis and applications. Our spatially explicit capture–recapture analysis demonstratesthat population recovery is possible in a multi-use landscape when managementactions target priority areas. We suggest that road density is a useful surrogatefor the negative effects of human land use on grizzly bear populations, but spatialconfiguration of roads must still be considered. Reducing roads will increase grizzlybear density, but restricting vehicle access can also achieve this goal. We demonstratethat a policy target of reducing human access by managing road densitybelow 0.6 km/km2, while ensuring areas of high habitat quality have no roads, is areasonable compromise between the need for road access and population recoverygoals. Targeting closures to areas of highest habitat quality would benefit grizzlybear population recovery the most.},
